/*
 * Geniuslink (dba GeoRiot Networks) is using a modified version of this code from Quartz 2.x.
 * The original code uses .NET Framework remoting CallContext (and HttpContext in the alternative)
 * to share thread-local data. This code is being used to avoid a rewrite of Quartz.Spi.MongoDBJobStore
 * which requires the LogicalThreadContext class, which was removed in Quartz 3. Remoting does not
 * exist on .NET Core at all, so AsyncLocal stands in for the CallContext.
